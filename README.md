The Dubbing and Audio description Profiles of TTML2, 
by the [Timed Text Working Group](https://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/TT/) 
is a profile of TTML2 suitable for the scripting, voicing and audio mixing 
of dubbing tracks and audio description for video.
This work was originally a combination of 
The [Audio Description Profile of TTML2](https://w3c.github.io/adpt/) 
, which was originally made by the [Audio Description Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/audio-description/), 
and [Timed Text Authoring Lineage (TTAL)](https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-netflix-timed-text-authoring-lineage-6fb57b72ad41). 

It is intended to meet the requirements set out in the 
[Requirements for Dubbing and Audio description](https://w3c.github.io/dapt-reqs/).
